        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p class="lead">Welcome! We are Stargazers, a relaxed and casual RotMG guild. Our goal is to build a close
        community that is friendly and helpful for everyone - both guild members and other players. We want to set
        an example through kind and thoughtful actions on the realm. We play on USWest2 and we are currently recruiting!</p>
        <h2>Discord</h2>
        <p class="lead">We have a public discord that everyone can join. However, please read the read-me when you
        first join the server. The permanent link is: https://discord.gg/0yTZ4SUckuugD4Cc</p>
        <h2>Guild Requirements:</h2>
        <p class="lead">1) You must not continuously show rude or hurtful behavior on discord or in game. This includes
        hacking, scamming, begging, or just being extremely annoying in general.<br/>
        2) You must have discord and join the guild server. Voice chat is highly recommended. <br/>
        3) You must be active at least for one hour each week. Please note that this is the bare minimum. If you can, one hour a day is optimal.<br/>
        4) Tomb/Shatters experience is highly recommended. If you do not know how to complete tombs or shatters, you must
        be willing to learn.<br/><br/>
        
        This is the application form. Please fill it out honestly.
        
        If you are accepted into the guild, you will be an initiate for a trial period of one week. During this week,
        we will see how well you interact with the guild. If you are a good fit for the guild, you will be promoted to
        member, and you will only be kicked if you go inactive for too long or break a rule more than once.</p>
